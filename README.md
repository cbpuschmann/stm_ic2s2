# stm_ic2s2
This page accompanies the Tutorial “Structural topic models for enriching quantitative text analysis” at the International Conference on Computational Social Science (IC2S2) in Amsterdam, NL, on July 17th 2019, organized by Carsten Schwemmer and Cornelius Puschmann.


For the tutorial, please make sure that you have access to a recent version of [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and preferably [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) on your computer. To save time, you can also install the R packages we need beforehand:

```
install.packages(c('tidyverse', 'stm', 'stminsights', 'quanteda', 'rmarkdown'), dependencies = TRUE)
```

For more information on the stm package, head over to http://www.structuraltopicmodel.com/.
